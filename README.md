# Remove Media

This script removes all media on a web page such as images and videos by deleting their respective HTML elements such as those with `img` and `video` HTML tags.

This is different from "blocking images" (ie. hiding) as offered by many browsers in that it doesn't allocate space for such elements by leaving rectangles and "dead icons" on such media.

I made this to focus on the text domain while browsing, and also to avoid toxic (unwanted, unsolicited) images that catch the eye unintentionally.
